EX4 files are meant to protect the intellectual property of the developers and prevent unauthorized modifications or reverse engineering. However, sometimes you might need to access the MQL4 source code from EX4 files for various reasons, such as:
 
- You lost or deleted the original MQ4 file and want to recover it.
- You purchased or downloaded an EX4 file and want to verify its functionality or modify it according to your needs.
- You want to learn from the code of other developers and improve your own skills.
- You want to fix bugs or errors in the EX4 file that affect its performance.

In such cases, you might wonder how to decompile EX4 file to MQ4 file. Decompilation is the process of converting a compiled file back into its source code form. However, this is not an easy task, especially for EX4 files that are encrypted or obfuscated.
 
Encryption is a technique that transforms the code into a secret format that can only be read by a specific key or password. Obfuscation is a technique that makes the code hard to read and understand by using complex names, symbols, or structures. Both encryption and obfuscation are used to prevent decompilation and protect the code from unauthorized access.
